# LETS LEARN

I created a website that allows access to the content of various modules on a single page.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is challenging to attend offline sessions; as a result, some sessions may fail to cover some of the fundamentals.
This website gives an overview of all the basic concepts in the first two modules, which were difficult compared to the other modules.
This site was useful for my friend to access the video in a single window.
